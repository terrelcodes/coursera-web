I skimmed the course on Coursera, https://www.coursera.org/learn/html-css-javascript-for-web-developers/

But when I got to the Javascript section, I decided that learning Javascript from a course last updated in 2014 was not a good use of my time, any more than learing Python 2.7.
Looking around, I decided to do the assessments from the front end learning path on MDN. 
This repo is where I will to that work.

## semantic markup

I learned that native editor support for the markup would be awesome. VS Code's default HTML editing leaves much to be desired. This may be because it is a text editor, not a markup editor.

The `<header>` element is a bit ambiguous. It seems I still need `<h[1-6]>` inside it.
Yup. It is not a substitute. (There is no document outline algorithm)[https://adrianroselli.com/2016/08/there-is-no-document-outline-algorithm.html] What a shamerâ€”it was a great idea.
