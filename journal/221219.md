I skimmed the course on Coursera, https://www.coursera.org/learn/html-css-javascript-for-web-developers/

But when I got to the Javascript section, I decided that learning Javascript from a course last updated in 2014 was not a good use of my time, any more than learing Python 2.7.
Looking around, I decided to do the assessments from the front end learning path on MDN. 
This repo is where I will to that work.
